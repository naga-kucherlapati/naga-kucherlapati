👋 Hi, I’m Naga

I’m a Data, AI & Technology Strategist, Product Leader, and Technical Program Manager focused on turning AI ambition into enterprise-scale adoption.

With 14+ years of experience across automotive, retail, finance, and food tech, I work at the intersection of AI systems, product strategy, and change execution. The technology is rarely the hardest part. Adoption is.

💡 What I work on here

This GitHub is a curated portfolio, not a dumping ground.

You’ll find:
- AI use cases designed for real organizations, not demos in isolation
- Context engineering and AI system experiments
- Human-in-the-loop and responsible AI patterns
- Adoption, governance, and AI readiness frameworks
- Clear documentation that explains why decisions were made, not just what was built

My focus is on clarity, trust, and scale.

🧠 How I think about AI

- Product-forward on vision, value, and outcomes
- Program-strong when orchestration, governance, and delivery matter
- Deeply invested in responsible AI, data trust, and capability building
- Believer that technology should feel approachable, practical, and human

📌 Featured work (start here)

Pinned repositories showcase:

🌱 Beyond GitHub

Alongside enterprise work, I created AI Lite, a digital proficiency and AI education initiative focused on building confidence and mindset, not just technical skills.
