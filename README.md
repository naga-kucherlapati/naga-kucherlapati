👋 Hi, I’m Naga

Technology is for everyone. My work is about making sure it actually feels that way.

I’m a Data and AI / Technology Strategist, Product Leader, and Technical Program Manager - turning executive ambition into enterprise adoption. I bring 14+ years of experience leading large-scale digital transformation across automotive, retail, finance, and food tech.

I move fluidly between products and programs. Product-forward on vision, value, and outcomes. Execution-strong when scale and coordination matter. My work sits at the intersection of AI, data, and people, because the tech is rarely the hardest part. Adoption is.

As a PROSCI-certified Change Leader in AI adoption, I bake change into products from day one. Trust, workflows, incentives, and capability are treated as core requirements, not downstream activities.

I operate in dual focus: telescopic in vision and microscopic in execution. Using Agile and SAFe, I translate strategy into roadmaps, value streams, epics, and program increments that actually ship.

💡 What I work on here

This GitHub is a curated portfolio of:

- AI use cases designed for real organizations, not demos in isolation
- Context engineering and AI system experiments
- Human-in-the-loop and responsible AI patterns
- Adoption, governance, and AI readiness frameworks
- Clear documentation that explains why decisions were made, not just what was built

My focus is on clarity, trust, and scale.

🧠 How I think about AI

- Product-forward on vision, value, and outcomes
- Program-strong when orchestration, governance, and delivery matter
- Deeply invested in responsible AI, data trust, and capability building
- Believer that technology should feel approachable, practical, and human
